## Introduction to S3
---

- <b> What is Object Storage (Object-based storage)? </b>
- data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures:
    - file systems: which manages data as files and fire hierarchy
    - block storage- which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks
        - S3 provides with <u> Unlimited storage </u>
        - Need not think about underlying infrastructure
        - S3 console provides an interface for you to upload and access your data 
        - Individual <u> Object </u> can be store form <u> 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes </u> in size

| **S3 Object**                                                                   | **S3 Bucket**                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Obejcts contain data(files)                                                   | - Buckets hold objects                                                  |
| - They are like files                                                           | - Buckets can have folders which can turn in hold objects               |
| Object may consists of:  </br> - <b> Key </b> this is the name of the object </br> - <b> Value </b> data iteself is made up of sequence of bytes   <br>- <b> Version Id </b> version of object (when versioning is enabled) <br> - <b> Metadata </b> additional information attached to the object                                               | - S3 is universal namespace so domain names must be <u> Unique </u> (like having a domain name)    |

## S3 Storage Classes 
--- 

- AWS offers a range of S3 Storage classes that<u> trade Retrieval, Time, Accessbility and Durability for Cheaper Storage </u>



### (Descending from expensive to cheaper)

<div style="display:flex;">
<img src="../images//S3/cheaper.png" width="15%" height = 500 float="right" />

<p float="right">

- <b> S3 Standard (default) </b>
    - Fast! 99.99 % Availibility, 
    - 11 9's Durability. 
    - Replicated accross at least thress AZs

- <b> S3 Intelleigent Tiering </b>
    - Uses ML to analyze object usage and determine the appropriate storage class
    - Data is moved to most cost-effective tier without any performance impact or added overhead

- <b> S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) </b>
    - Still Fast! Cheaper if you access files less than once a month
    - <u> Additional retrieval fee is applied</u>. 50% less than standard (reduced availability)

- <b> S3 One-Zone-IA </b>
    - Still fast! Objects only exist in one AZ. 
    - Availability (is 99.5%). but cheaper than Standard IA by 20% less 
    - reduces durability
    - Data could be destroyed 
    - Retrieval fee is applied

- <b> S3 Glacier </b>
    - For long term cold storage
    - Retrieval of data can take minutes to hours but the off is <u> very cheap storage </u>

- <b> S3 Glacier Deep Archive </b>
    - The lowest cost storage class
    - Data retrieval time is 12 hours
